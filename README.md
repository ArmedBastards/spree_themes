## Usage

Once install, admin can see the option to upload themes under configuration tab at backend. Admin needs to upload the theme zip file in specific file structure. Once uploaded, admin can compile and publish the theme. Only after publishing, the theme will be applied to the frontend store.

By default, spree default frontend theme is pbulished and viewed on frontend.

File structure for the zip file to be uploaded:-
* Theme.zip
  * javascripts
  * stylesheets
  * views: These views will be the spree frontend view directory.
  * snapshot.png: This is the snapshot for the theme visible at backend.
  * meta_info.yml: This .yml file contains meta info of the theme.

Create a meta_info.yml file on the theme directory which contains the meta info of the theme. Format of the file should be following:-
 * name: Name of the theme
 * version: Version of the theme
 * authors: Authors of the theme


*Note:- Add new javascript files to javascripts directory and new stylesheet files to stylesheets directory. For adding js and css manifest files, file name should be script.manifest.js or style.manifest.js*

*Note:- When uploading, files starting with '__' or '.' will be ignored*
