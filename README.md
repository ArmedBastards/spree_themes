By default, spree default frontend theme is pbulished and viewed on frontend.

File structure for the zip file to be uploaded:-
* Theme.zip
  * javascripts
  * stylesheets
  * views (these views will be the spree frontend view directory)
  * snapshot.png (this is the snapshot for the theme visible at backend)

*Note:- Add new javascript files to javascripts directory and new stylesheet files to stylesheets directory. For adding js and css manifest files, file name should be script.manifest.js or style.manifest.js*

*Note:- When uploading, files starting with '__' or '.' will be ignored*
